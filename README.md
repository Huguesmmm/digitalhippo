### What I learned
The main goals in learning are the setup of the reusable components and how to securly make transaction possible on ecommerce.

1. Reusable components

    This tutorial shows very well when you need a component and how to create it and use it. 

    For example, the use of an MaxWidthWrapper that wrap the main application for an even style across the application.

2. Hanlding state
   
   I learn how to hangling state for the display of elements of the navbar for exemple.

3. Using tRPC

    Using the component Providers, I learn how to use tRPC for all of my backend.
